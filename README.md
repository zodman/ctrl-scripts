# Control scripts applied to a database

# the need

I imagine that you have had the situation of creating a script to fix a database
this script you run it once, and then the system or the database is
already working fine.

but then you repeat the situation and you have to make another different script
that you are only going to apply it once.

then it becomes a list of scripts to run 1 time on something.

When you bring a backup, you have to apply all the scripts you already used on
the system/database to bring it up to par with the others.

How do you keep track of the applied scripts ?
